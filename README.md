This project uses data found at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o6DD19jWrKtSpgjxTLZrg6QgDyCvPmeS
All of my code files will require you to link the files as they are stored on your machine. I will not be specifying that in each step of my SOP. 

Standard opeating procedure:
1. Download all practice vector data that you plan to use, as well as the Shrine_bowl_players file
2. Run RosterCreator.final to generate a roster for each practice you want to analyze
3. Upload the output file(s) to gemini/chatGPT and ask it to tell you the positions each player played at the shrine bowl
4. Copy paste the position data into the roster CSV file
5. Run BulkMatchupFinder.final on the player tracking files and the recently created roster CSV files
6. Run BulkAnalysis.final with the output CSV files from BulkMatchupFinder.final alongside the player tracking files
7. Take the output CSV files from BulkAnalysis.final and conduct manual data analysis on MS Excel
